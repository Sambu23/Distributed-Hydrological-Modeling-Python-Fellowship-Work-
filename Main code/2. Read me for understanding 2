# Combine_PET_Precip_LST_and_Runoff_Modeling.py

## Purpose:
This script combines three meteorological inputs:
1. Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)
2. Precipitation (P)
3. Land Surface Temperature (LST)

The script integrates these inputs into a single Excel file and runs a hydrological model. The model generates the following outputs:
- Simulated runoff
- SVecWR (Storage of wet region (snow))
- UR (Unsaturated Zone Storage) for each raster pixel.

The output is stored as raster data for spatial analysis.
