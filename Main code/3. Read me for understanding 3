# Sum_Raster_Pixels_to_Volume_and_Plot_Observed_Runoff.py

## Purpose:
This script performs the following tasks:
1. Aggregates pixel-wise raster data to calculate total runoff volume (in mm).
2. Compares the modeled runoff volume with observed runoff data.
3. Plots the results for visualization and analysis (in mm/month).

### Inputs:
- Raster file representing distributed runoff.
- Observed runoff data for validation.

### Outputs:
- Total runoff volume (calculated from raster pixels).
- Plot comparing modeled and observed runoff.
