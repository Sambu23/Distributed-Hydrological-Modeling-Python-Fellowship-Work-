Data Processing Codes

These Python scripts were used to manipulate hydrological data into desired forms and extract data from formats like NetCDF files to specific shapefiles:

1. Converting daily discharge (m3/s) data to monthly discharge (m3/s and mm).py:
Converts daily discharge data into monthly totals for hydrological analysis.

2. Converting Excel file to raster (.tif).py:
Converts Excel files containing hydrological data into raster format (.tif) for spatial analysis.

3. NetCDF to Raster of specific locations.py:
Extracts data from NetCDF files for specific locations or regions defined by shapefiles.

4. Removing -9999 values from raster files.py:
Cleans raster files by replacing placeholder values (-9999) with NaN or other appropriate values for analysis.
